# Serval - Survey Acquisition Management #

The [Serval Project][sp] is focused on delivering the Serval Mesh application. The Serval Mesh software is revolutionary, free, open-source software under development for mobile telephones, letting them communicate even in the absence of phone towers and other supporting infrastructure. 

The Serval - Survey Acquisition Management application is a fork of the MaGDAA - Survey Acquisition Management application.

The [Mass Gathering Data Acquisition and Analysis][magdaa] project, MaGDAA for short, is a collaboration between the [Flinders University Disaster Research Centre][fudrc] and [The Serval Project][sp] at [Flinders University][fusa] in South Australia.

The focus of this port is on the use of the SAM application on mobile phones and earlier versions of the Android operating system. 

The purpose of the Survey Acquisition Management (SAM) software is designed to:

1. Make it easy for a user to select a survey from a list
2. Automatically launch the survey in the [ODK Collect][odk] application
3. Create a file containing all of a finalised survey form and share on the mesh network
